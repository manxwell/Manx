<p title="

As we begin our investigation of the imagination, it is important that we are clear on what is to be investigated.

">

当我们开始对想象进行调查时，重要的是我们要明确要调查的内容。

</p>

<p title="

In particular, I want to point out that while there are lots of ordinary language uses of the word 'imagine' and its cognates, not all of these correspond to the phenomenon in which we are interested.

">

我要特别指出的是，虽然“想象”一词及其同源词有很多日常语言用法，但并非所有这些都与我们感兴趣的现象相对应。

</p>

<p title="

Many of these, I expect, are rather easy to spot.

">

我预计，其中许多很容易被发现。

</p>

<p title="

To give a trivial example, someone might respond 'Imagine that!' to some surprising piece of news, and yet we would by no means understand this to imply an exercise of the speaker's imagination, nor would it be properly understood as a command for the listener to do so.

">

举一个简单的例子，有人可能会回答“想象一下！” 一些令人惊讶的消息，但我们绝不会将其理解为暗示着说话者的想象力的锻炼，也不能正确地将其理解为对听众的命令。

</p>

<p title="

In this instance, the word 'imagine' functions simply as part of an idiomatic exclamation. Another common use of the word is to signal supposition or, perhaps more commonly, mistaken supposition.

">

在这种情况下，“想象”这个词只是作为惯用感叹词的一部分起作用。这个词的另一个常见用法是表示假设，或者更常见的是错误的假设。

</p>

<p title="

We might say of a high school teacher, 'The teacher imagined that her students had done their homework,' and mean simply that she made an incorrect assumption.4 Of course, this same statement in a different context might be used to refer to a teacher who attempted to escape the reality of her students' indolence by exercising her imagination.

">

我们可能会说一位高中老师，“老师想象她的学生已经完成了他们的家庭作业”，只是意味着她做了一个错误的假设。 4当然，在不同的上下文中，这个相同的陈述可能被用来指代一个试图通过发挥想象力来逃避学生懒惰现实的老师。

</p>

<p title="

Context, then, helps to make clear whether the word 'imagine' refers to an actual exercise of the imagination, and it should not present much trouble to separate out those which refer merely to an exercise of supposi- tion.' Consider also the following passage from Gilbert Ryle: There are hosts of widely divergent sorts of behaviour in the conduct of which we should ordi- narily and correctly be described as imaginative.

">

因此，上下文有助于明确“想象”这个词是否指的是实际的想象练习，将那些仅指假设练习的词区分开来应该不会有太大的麻烦。还请考虑吉尔伯特·赖尔 (Gilbert Ryle) 的以下段落： 在行为中，我们通常应正确且正确地将各种行为描述为富有想象力的行为。

</p>

<p title="

The mendacious witness in the witness-box, the inventor thinking of a new machine, the constructor of a romance, the child playing bears, and Henry Irving are all exercising their imaginations; but so, too, are the judge listening to the lies of the witness, the colleague giving his opinion on the new invention, the novel reader, the nurse who refrains from admonishing the 'bears' for their subhuman noises, the dramatic critic, and the theatre-goer.6 I take Ryle to be making two distinct claims here: first, that we would judge all of these people to be imaginative based on these widely divergent activi- ties, and second, that we would describe the people engaged in these various activities as exercising their imaginations.

">

证人席上的虚伪证人、想出新机器的发明者、浪漫的缔造者、玩熊的孩子、亨利·欧文都在发挥想象力；但同样如此，听取证人谎言的法官、对新发明发表意见的同事、小说读者、避免警告“熊”的非人类噪音的护士、戏剧评论家以及6 我认为赖尔在这里提出了两个不同的主张：首先，我们会根据这些广泛不同的活动判断所有这些人都富有想象力，其次，我们将描述从事这些各种各样的活动就像锻炼他们的想象力。

</p>

<p title="

Ryle's first claim is uncontrover- sial.

">

莱尔的第一个主张是没有争议的。

</p>

<p title="

I would, however, take issue with his second claim.

">

然而，我会反对他的第二个主张。

</p>

<p title="

Just as there is a use of the word 'imagine' which corresponds merely to an exercise of suppo- sition, and not an exercise of the imagination, there is a use of the word 'imaginative' (and perhaps this is even the most common use of the word) which corresponds merely to an exercise of creativity, and not an exercise of the imagination.

">

正如“想象”一词的用法仅对应于假设的练习，而不是想象的练习，“想象”一词也有使用（也许这甚至是最常见的）词的使用），这仅对应于创造力的锻炼，而不是想象力的锻炼。

</p>

<p title="

Our use of the word 'imaginative,' I am claiming, far out- runs our actual use of the imagination. With this understood, let us return to the example with which we began: my imagining Bill Clinton sitting in a prison cell.7 I have picked up a fair amount of information about Clinton over the years, from television, news- papers, and the like.

">

我声称，我们对“想象力”一词的使用远远超出了我们对想象力的实际使用。理解了这一点，让我们回到开始的例子：我想象的比尔·克林顿坐在牢房里。 7 多年来，我从电视、报纸和喜欢。

</p>

<p title="

It thus seems clear that he is someone whom I can imag- ine.

">

因此很明显，他是我能想象到的人。

</p>

<p title="

But what makes it the case that I do so? There are two very different aspects to this question.

">

但是是什么让我这样做呢？这个问题有两个截然不同的方面。

</p>

<p title="

First, there is what we might call the internal aspect, which concerns the mental exercise itself, in abstraction from the particular content to be imagined: what makes my imagining Bill Clinton an instance of imagining- as opposed to, say, an instance of perceiving, believing, or halluci- nating? In contrast, the external aspect concerns the particular content itself: what makes my imagining Bill Clinton an imagining about Bill Clinton-as opposed to another person, or to nothing at all? By separating these two aspects of the question before us, we are reminded that the success of an imagining cannot be determined solely by-to put it metaphorically-looking inside the imaginer's head.

">

首先，我们可以称之为内在方面，它涉及心理锻炼本身，从要想象的特定内容中抽象出来：是什么让我的想象比尔·克林顿成为想象的实例，而不是比方说，感知的实例，相信，还是产生幻觉？相比之下，外在方面与特定内容本身有关：是什么让我对比尔克林顿的想象成为对比尔克林顿的想象——而不是另一个人，或者根本没有？通过将摆在我们面前的问题的这两个方面分开，我们被提醒，一个想象的成功不能仅仅靠——用比喻的方式把它放在想象者的脑海里。

</p>

<p title="

The external aspect forces our focus outward, by asking what it is for my imagining to be about one person or thing in the world rather than another.

">

外在方面迫使我们的注意力向外，通过询问我的想象是关于世界上的一个人或事物而不是另一个。

</p>

<p title="

But, for our purposes, perhaps the most important reason to separate these two aspects of our ques- tion is so that we can consciously set the external aspect aside.

">

但是，就我们的目的而言，将问题的这两个方面分开的最重要原因可能是我们可以有意识地将外部方面放在一边。

</p>

<p title="

Whether mental images belong in an account of the imagination is an issue that must be settled on the internal front. .

">

心理意象是否属于想象的叙述，是一个必须在内在前沿解决的问题。。
