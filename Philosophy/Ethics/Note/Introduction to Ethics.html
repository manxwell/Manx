How should we live?</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Plato’s Euthyphro – Prologue: What is piety? (p. 35-37/2a-5d)</h3><ul><li><p>Socrates and Euthyphro are both on the way to the court-house.</p></li><li><p>Socrates informs Euthyphro that he has been indicted for corrupting the youth and impiety towards the gods (35)</p></li><li><p>Euthyphro is prosecuting his own father for the murder of one of his day-laborers. (36)</p><ul><li></p>The father then bound the laborer and placed him in a ditch while he waited for the authorities. But in the mean-time, the laborer died. </p></li><li><p>Note: Euthyphro’s actions would have been considered a violation of one’s duties towards one’s father.</p></li><li><p>But Euthyphro insists that everyone should prosecute a murderer, whenever someone is killed unjustly, no matter who. </p></li><li><p>Ethical question: Do we have special duties towards our family-members? Or should we treat them exactly the same as everyone else?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Euthyphro’s relatives say that it is impiousfor him to prosecute his own father. But Euthyphro disagrees. “You see, it’s impious, they say, for a son to prosecute his father for murder. Little do they know, Socrates, about the gods’ position on the pious and the impious!” (37/4d-e)</p></li><li><p>Socrates declares he will enlist Euthyphro to teach him about the meaning of piety, so that Socrates can defend himself against the charge of impiety.</p></li></ul><h3>Euthyphro’s First Definition of Piety (p. 37-38/5d-6e)</h3><ul><li><p>Euthyphro’s first definition of piety: “I say that what’s pious is precisely what I’m doing now: prosecuting those who commit an injustice, such as murder or temple robbery, or those who’ve done some other wrong, regardless of whether they’re one’s father or one’s mother or anyone else whatever. Not prosecuting them, on the other hand, is what’s impious.” (37/5d-e)</p><ul><p><li>Euthyphro’s proof by example: Zeus imprisoned his own father Kronos in the Underworld. And Kronos castrated his own father Uranus. So even the gods recognize that one must punish one’s own fathers, when necessary. </p></li><p><li>Socrates are suspicious that the gods are really like this...</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates’ Objection: Euthyphro has merely offered an example of something pious (namely, prosecuting one’s father for an injustice). But Socrates wants to know what piety itself is. </p></li><ul><li><p>“Do you remember, then, that what I urged you to do wasn’t to teach me about one or two of the many pieties, but rather about the form itself, by virtue of which all the pieties are pious? You see, you said, I believe, that it was by virtue of one characteristic that the impieties are impious, and the pieties pious. Or don’t you remember? ... Then teach me what that characteristic itself is, in order that by concentrating on it and using it as a model, I may call pious any action of yours or anyone else’s that is such as it, and may deny to be pious whatever isn’t such as it.” (38)</p></li><li><p>Philosophical Point: This is what we search for in philosophy. Philosophy isn’t about accumulating examples. It’s about concepts of things, definitions of things, ideas of things. (The ideas of, e.g. piety, justice, truth, goodness, beauty, etc. Or: The Forms. ) </p></li></ul></ul><h3>Euthyphro’s Second Definition of Piety (p. 38-40/6e-9d)</h3><ul><li><p>Euthyphro’s second definition of piety: “In that case: what’s loved by the gods is pious, and what’s not loved by the gods is impious.” (38/7a)</p></li><li><p>Socrates’ first objection: The gods disagree among themselves about what is good or bad, i.e. what to love or not to love. So the gods disagree about what is pious and impious. (38-39)</p><ul><li><p>Euthyphro’s response: But the gods all agree on at least some things. For example: All the gods hate murder, and so murder is clearly impious, and the prosecution of a murderer is pious. </p><ul><li><p>Socrates’ response: But the gods may disagree over whether a given action falls under the category ‘murder’. For example: The case of Euthyphro’s father – his father’s killing of a day-laborer who he bound and placed in a pit while waiting for the authorities – seems open to disagreement. </p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates: Even if we grant that Euthyphro’s prosecution of his father is pious, what have we really learned about piety by saying that it is ‘what the gods love’? Why do the gods love this?</p></li></ul><h3>Euthyphro’s Third Definition (p. 40-42/9d-11d)</h3><ul><li><p>Euthyphro’s third definition of piety: “All right, I’d say that the pious is what all the gods love, and its opposite, what all the gods hate, is the impious.” (40/9e)</p></li><ul><li><p>Socrates’s question: “Is the pious loved by the gods because it’s pious? Or is it pious because it’s loved by the gods?” (40/10a)[The Euthyphro Dilemma!]</p></li><li><p>Option #1: If the pious is loved by the gods because it is [already] pious, then it is pious independently of the gods. Piety pre-exists the gods’ love. And so the question remains: What is piety? What makes something pious?</p><ul><li><p>Example: Suppose murder is impious independent of the gods’ love. But why is murder impious, then?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>merely depends on what the gods happen to love. (And presumably the gods could have loved something else, which means that the pious is arbitrary.) So the question remains: Why do the gods love this and not that? </p><ul><li><p>Example: Suppose murder is impious because the gods hate it. But why do they hate it?</p><p>And if they had instead loved it, would that have made murder pious? </p></li></ul></li><li><p>(Another monotheistic version of the dilemma in terms of God and ‘rightness’: Is what is right/good commanded by God because it is right/good? Or is it right/good because it is commanded by God?</p><ul><li><p>If what is right is commanded by God because it is right, then ‘rightness’ exists independentlyof God (God is just the messenger, and is bound by independent standards – therefore not all-powerful). But then the question remains: What is right? What makes something right?</p></li><li><p>If what is right is right merely because God commanded it, then rightness is arbitrary (God could have commanded something else). And the question remains: Why did God command this and not that?)</p></li></ul></li></ul></ul><h3>The Euthyphro Dilemma</h3><body><script type="text/tikz">$$\hspace{50ex}\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.75pt,y=0.75pt,yscale=-1,xscale=1][id:dp01846884627616574] \draw  [color={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,draw opacity=1 ][fill={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,fill opacity=1 ] (90,207.4) -- (97.75,207.4) -- (97.75,178) -- (113.25,178) -- (113.25,207.4) -- (121,207.4) -- (105.5,227) -- cycle ;[id:dp16996858229998457] \draw  [color={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,draw opacity=1 ][fill={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,fill opacity=1 ] (509,207.4) -- (516.75,207.4) -- (516.75,178) -- (532.25,178) -- (532.25,207.4) -- (540,207.4) -- (524.5,227) -- cycle ;[id:dp6411747388142486] \draw  [color={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,draw opacity=1 ][fill={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,fill opacity=1 ] (489,54) -- (516.5,54) -- (516.5,70) -- (509,70) -- (524,90) -- (539,70) -- (531.5,70) -- (531.5,39) -- (489,39) -- cycle ;[id:dp6265166028245741] \draw  [color={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,draw opacity=1 ][fill={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,fill opacity=1 ] (140,56) -- (112.5,56) -- (112.5,72) -- (120,72) -- (105,92) -- (90,72) -- (97.5,72) -- (97.5,41) -- (140,41) -- cycle ;\draw  [color={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,draw opacity=1 ][fill={rgb, 255:red, 50; green, 50; blue, 50 }  ,fill opacity=1 ]  (159,7) -- (467,7) -- (467,74) -- (159,74) -- cycle  ;\draw (160,8) node [anchor=north west][inner sep=0.75pt]  [color={rgb, 255:red, 255; green, 255; blue, 255 }  ,opacity=1 ] [align=left] {$"$Is the pious loved by the gods because it$'$s\\pious?

(42)</li></p><li><p>Socrates’ question: Are ‘pious’ and ‘just’ synonymous? Is everything pious also just, and everything just also pious?</li><ul><li><p>Euthyphro concedes that piety is just a part of justice. Socrates asks him which part of justice piety is.</p></li><li><p>Euthyphro: Piety is about justice with respect to the gods, while the other parts of justice pertain to relations with human beings. Specifically, piety is about ‘tending’ to the gods, i.e., providing them with a certain ‘service’. </p><ul><li><p>Socrates: What sort of ‘service’ does piety render to the gods?</p></li><li><p>Euthyphro: It’s hard to give an exact answer. But it has to do with offering the proper prayers and sacrifices. Such prayers and sacrifices help preserve the welfare of the household and of the city. (43-44) </p></li></ul></li></ul></p></ul><h3>Euthyphro’s Fifth Definition of Piety (p. 44/14b-15c) </h3><ul><li><p>Fifth definition: Piety is “some sort of knowledge of sacrificing and praying” (44/14c)</p><ul><li><p>Praying is about asking from the gods, sacrifice is about giving to the gods. </p><ul><li><p>Socrates: We ask the gods for what we need, and we give to them what they need? So piety would be “a sort of expertise in mutual trading between gods and men”? (44/14e)</p></li><li><p>Euthyphro: Yes. </p></li><li><p>Socrates: But don’t we receive everything from the gods? And aren’t the gods in need of nothing? What could we possibly give the gods?</p></li><li><p>Euthyphro: We can give the gods honor and reverence. Honor and reverence are pleasing to the gods. To give the gods what is pleasing to them is piety.</p></li><li><p>Socrates: But why is this pleasing to the gods? Because the gods love it? But this simply brings us back to the earlier problematic definition of piety as ‘what the gods love’. We’ve gone in a circle!  </p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Epilogue (p. 44-45/15c-d)</h3><ul><li><p>Socrates: “So we must examine again from the beginning what the pious is, since I won’t willingly give up until I learn this. Don’t scorn me, but apply your mind to the matter in as many ways and as fully as you can, and then tell me the truth – for you must know it, if indeed, any human being does, and, like Proteus, you mustn’t be let go until you tell it. For if you didn’t know with full clarity what the pious and the impious are, you’d never have ventured to prosecute your old father for murder on behalf of a day laborer. On the contrary, you wouldn’t have risked acting wrongly because you’d have been afraid before the gods and ashamed before men. As thing stand, however, I well know that you think you have fully clear knowledge of what’s pious and what isn’t. So tell me what you think it is, my excellent Euthyphro, and don’t conceal it.” (44-45/15d)</p><ul><li>[Heavy Socratic irony!]</li></ul></li><li><p>Euthyphro: “Some other time, Socrates. You see, I’m in a hurry to get somewhere, and its time for me to be off.”</p></li><li><p>Socrates: “What a way to treat me, my friend! Going off like that and dashing the high hopes I had that I’d learn from you what things are pious and what aren’t. Then I’d escape Meletus’ indictment by showing him that Euthyphro had now made me wise in religious matters, and ignorance would no longer cause me to improvise and innovate about them. What’s more, I’d live a better way for the rest of my life.” </p><ul><li>[Socrates would go on to be executed for impiety.] </li></ul></li></li></ul><h3>Aporia in the Platonic Dialogue</h3><ul><li><p>As in many of Plato’s early dialogues, the Euthyphro ends in aporia– literally an “impasse”, more generally a state of “puzzlement” or “confusion”.</p></li><li><p>In essence, aporia means that the question under consideration (in this case, “What is piety?”) has not been satisfactorily answered. </p></li><li><p>Is aporia a bad thing? Sometimes in philosophy, asking the right question is more important than finding the answer.</p><ul><li><p>And in fact, haven’t we learned a great deal about what piety is not over the course of the dialogue? This is very helpful information!</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(But don’t worry: in Plato’s Republic – one of Plato’s middle dialogues – Socrates will answer the question “What is justice?”)</p></li></ul></div><br><br><br><br><div class=box><h2 id = p1.2>Plato, Apology; Crito; Phaedo (115b-118a)</h2><hr><h2 id = p1.2.1>Plato, Apology</h2><p><a onclick="document.getElementById('frame2').src = 'https://www.sjsu.edu/people/james.lindahl/courses/Phil70A/s3/apology.pdf';"><button style = "background-color: black; color : white; float:left;">e-Book</button></a><a onclick="document.getElementById('frame2').src = 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/pK70IMpjfBg?autoplay=1';"><button style = "background-color: black; color : white; float:left;">Audio</button></a></p><iframe id="frame2"src="https://www.sjsu.edu/people/james.lindahl/courses/Phil70A/s3/apology.pdf" style="width:100%; height:90.2%;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>Recap of Previous Lecture (Plato’s Euthyphro)</h3><ul><li><p>Socrates is charged with (1) corrupting the youth, and (2) impiety towards the gods. </p></li><li><p>Socrates asks Euthyphro to answer the question “What is piety?” on the way to the courthouse. </p></li><li><p>None of Euthyphro’s answers are ultimately coherent or satisfying (due to the Euthyphro Dilemma and other associated problems). </p></li><li><p>Socrates is obliged to face the charge of impiety without having learned from Euthyphro what piety really is!</p></li></ul><h3>Plato’s Apology – Background </h3><ul><li><p>In Greek, ἀπολογία (apologia) does not mean ‘saying sorry’.

But he will speak the truth. (46/17a-c)</p><ul><li><p>Socrates has never spoken before the courts, despite being 70 years old. He asks the jury not to be offended if he speaks as he does in the marketplace.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates says that he has been slandered in public, for example by the comic playwright Aristophanes, whose play the Clouds depicts Socrates as a corrupter of the youth. (47/18b-d)</p><ul><li><p>The play mounts the following accusation: “Socrates commits injustice and is a busybody, in that he investigates the things beneath the earth and in the heavens, makes the weaker argument the stronger, and teaches these things to others.”</p></li><li><p>In other words, the play depicts Socrates as a sophist– a paid teacher of rhetoric in Athens, who teaches one how to argue their case before the Assembly or the Courts, even if one is in the wrong. </p><ul><li><p>But Socrates does not charge anyone. And he teaches the truth, not mere rhetorical persuasion.  </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates recognizes that the jury may wonder how it is that he has come to be slandered in this way. Mustn’t he have been doing something wrong, in order to have acquired this bad reputation? Socrates will explain the story. (48/20c-d)</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates and the Delphic Oracle (1)(p. 49-51/20e-24b)</h3><ul><li><p>One day, Socrates’ friend Chaerephon asked the Oracle at Delphi whether anyone in Athens was wiser than Socrates. The Oracle replied that Socrates was the wisest person in Athens. (49/21a)</p></li><li><p>When Socrates heard this, he thought there must be some mistake. For Socrates never thought he had any wisdom to speak of. </p></li><li><p>So Socrates decided he would work to prove the Oracle wrong. He would go to the marketplace and speak with the truly wise men of Athens, and in hearing the wisdom they have, Socrates would show that he was not the wisest. </p></li><li><p>But when Socrates went to speak to people, and asked them to share their wisdom by answering questions like “What is piety?”, “What is justice?”, “What is virtue?”, and so on, he found that people’s answers didn’t make sense. These people didn’t actually know the things they claimed to know. </p></li><li><p>“And when I examined him and talked with him, men of Athens, my experience was something like this: I thought this man seemed wise to many people, and especially to himself, but wasn’t. Then I tried to show him that he thought himself wise, but wasn’t. As a result, he came to dislike me, and so did many of the people present. For my part, I thought to myself as I left, “I’m wiser than that person. For it’s likely that neither of us knows anything fine and good, but he thinks he knows something he doesn’t know, whereas I, since I don’t in fact know, don’t think that I do either. At any rate, it seems that I’m wiser than he in just this one small way: that what I don’t know, I don’t think I know.” Next, I approached another man, one of those thought to be wiser than the first, and it seemed to me that the same thing occurred, and so I came to be disliked by that man too, as well as by many others.” (49/21c-e)</p><ul><li><p>Often summarized: ‘The only thing I know is that I know nothing.’ </p><ul><li><p>[Consider the example of Euthyphro!]</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates and the Delphic Oracle (2)(p. 49-51/20e-24b)</h3><ul><li><p>Though Socrates’ questioning was arousing hostility, he continued on his quest, in reverence of the god of the Oracle. </p><ul><li><p>Socrates does not possess any special wisdom about the things he asks other about (e.g. piety, justice, virtue, the good). Rather, he simply reveals that others do not have this wisdom. It is as if the Oracle were to say: “That one among you is wisest, mortals, who, like Socrates, has recognized that he’s truly worthless where wisdom’s concerned.” (50/23b) </p></li><li><p>“So even now I continue to investigate these things and to examine, in response to the god, any person, citizen, or foreigner I believe to be wise. Whenever he seems not to be so to me, I come to the assistance of the god and show him that he’s not wise. Because of this occupation, I’ve had no leisure worth talking about for either the city’s affairs or my own domestic ones; rather, I live in extreme poverty because of my service to the god.” (50/23b)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Young people like to follow Socrates around to hear him question others. </p><ul><li><p>Some think Socrates is thereby corrupting these young people. But he is doing no such thing. They are only witnessing the pursuit of wisdom and truth. </p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates’ Defence Against the Two Charges(p. 51-54/24b-28b)</h3><ul><li><p>Two charges against Socrates: “Socrates is guilty of corrupting the young, and of not acknowledging the gods the city acknowledges, but new daimonic activities instead.” (51/24b)</p></li><li><p>First Charge: Corrupting the Youth</p><ul><li><p>Socrates demonstrates to his accuser Meletus that no one does evil intentionally – everyone does what they believe to be good. So if Socrates is doing evil by interacting with the youth in the way he does, he must be doing such evil unintentionally (for Socrates believes it to be good, not evil). But then Socrates shouldn’t by punished, but rather instructed by Meletus on what is truly good. (52/25d-26a)</p></li><li><p>Famously summarized: ‘Ignorance is the root of all evil.’</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Second Charge: Impiety towards the Gods</p><ul><li><p>Meletus claims that Socrates is corrupting the youth by denying the reality of the gods. </p></li><li><p>But Socrates points out that the indictment contradicts this. The indictment says that Socrates has introduced ‘new daimonic activities’. But daimons are a kind of god, or children of gods. So Socrates clearly does not deny the existence of all gods, since he acknowledges the existence of his ‘new’ daimons. [Note: Daimon does not mean ‘evil demon’. It simply means any superhuman spiritual being.] (53/27a-e)</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates on Life and Death(p. 54/28b-29b)</h3><ul><li><p>Socrates is willing to stake his life on his philosophical activity:</p><ul><li><p>“But perhaps someone may say, “Aren’t you ashamed, Socrates, to have engaged in the sort of occupation that has now put you at risk of death?” I, however, would be right to reply to him, “You’re not thinking straight, sir, if you think that a man who’s any use at all should give any opposing weight to the risk of living or dying, instead of looking to this alone whenever he does anything: whether his actions are just or unjust, the deeds of a good or bad man.” (54/28b) [Ethical question: Are some values worth dying for?] </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Just as Socrates stood his ground in battle, he will stand his ground in philosophizing.</p><ul><li><p>Indeed, he has been appointed to this station by the god. If he were to give it up out of fear for his own life, that would be true impiety towards the gods. </p></li><li><p>For all we know, death may be a passageway to a better life. But we know for certain that acting badly in this life is wrong. </p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates the Gadfly(p. 54-56/29b-31c)</h3><ul><p><li>If Socrates were to be released on condition that he cease from practicing philosophy, he would refuse. (55/29c-d)</p></li><p><li>Socrates is in fact giving a great service to the city: “I believe that no greater good for you has ever come about in the city than my service to the god. You see, I do nothing else except go around trying to persuade you, both young and old alike, not to care about your bodies or your money as intensely as about how your soul may be in the best possible condition” – that is, about justice, piety, virtue, goodness, etc. (55/30a-b)</p><ul><p><li>Killing Socrates will in fact harm the city of Athens much more than it will harm Socrates. </p></li><p><li>Socrates provides the service of the “gadfly” of the city of Athens – one who ‘awakens, cajoles, and reproaches’ the citizens in the service of the cause of justice, virtue, and goodness. </p></li><p><li>Clearly Socrates does not perform this service for his own sake. He has neglected his own affairs for years, for the sake of helping others to grow in knowledge and wisdom, without ever asking for payment.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates on Politics and Oratory(p. 56-59/31c-35d)</h3><ul><li><p>Why did Socrates not participate in the Assembly [the democratic legislative body of Athens]?</p><ul><li><p>Socrates has a ‘daimon’ – a voice that only he can hear – that instructs him on things to avoid. The daimon told him to avoid public discourse, but instead to focus his philosophical activities on private conversations. (56/31c-e)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates did challenge political authority on multiple occasions:</p><ul><li><p>Socrates was the only one to vote against an unjust group prosecution of naval soldiers after a battle, despite threats of punishment on himself for doing so. (Group prosecution was known to be unjust.)</p></li><li><p>Under the reign of the Thirty Tyrants, Socrates refused to arrest Leon of Salamis and bring him before the tyrants to be executed, despite the danger this posed to Socrates himself. (56-57/32c-d)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates will not break down in tears, or bring his wife and children before the jury, in order to try to elicit sympathy for his plight. He prefers to simply present the justice of his case. (58-59/34b-35d)</p><ul><li><p>If Socrates did try such rhetorical tricks, he would be encouraging the jury to violate their own oath to uphold justice.</p><p> That would be true impiety towards the gods.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates’ Sentencing (p. 59-61/35e-38b)</h3><ul><li><p>Offstage, Socrates is convicted. Meletus demands the death penalty. Socrates is given the right to offer a counter-proposal for his penalty. </p></li><li><p>Socrates says that he has only tried to offer the “greatest benefaction” to the city, by encouraging its citizens to become the best and wisest people they can be. Thus his proper ‘punishment’ should be free meals in the Prytaneum! (59-60/36b-37a) <b>[Socratic humor!]</b></p><ul><li><p>Socrates is convinced that he has does no injustice. So it would be unjust if his proposed a true punishment for himself. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates asks: Should he propose to pay a fine? Imprisonment? Exile?</p></li></ul><h3>Socrates’ Sentencing (p. 59-61/35e-38b)</h3><ul><li><p>Fine: Socrates does not have the money to pay.</p></li><li><p>Imprisonment: Socrates does not want to be enslaved to the prison-guards. (He knows imprisonment will be bad, whereas death may be good.)  </p></li><li><p>Exile: Socrates would run into the same trouble wherever he went. </p></li><li><p>“Now perhaps someone may say, “But by keeping quiet and minding your own business, Socrates, wouldn’t it be possible for you to live in exile for us?” This is the very hardest point on which to convince some of you. You see, if I say that to do that would be to disobey the god, and that this is why I can’t mind my own business, you won’t believe me, since you’ll suppose I’m being ironical. But again, if I say it’s the greatest good for a man to discuss virtue every day, and the other things you’ve heard me discussing and examining myself and others about, on the ground that the unexamined life isn’t worth livingfor a human being, you’ll believe me even less when I say that. But in fact, things are just as I claim them to be, men of Athens, though it isn’t easy to convince you of them.” (60/37e-38a) </p></li><li><p>Socrates says he would be happy to pay a fine if he had the money, since he doesn’t care about money. </p><ul><li><p>Socrates’ friends (including Plato) intervene, proposing a fine of thirty minas.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Quote</h3><blockquote>The unexamined life is not worth living. ~Socrates</blockquote><h3>After Socrates’ Sentencing(p. 61-63/38b-41c) </h3><ul><li><p>Offstage, Socrates is sentenced to the death penalty.</p></li><li><p>Socrates wants the jurors to know that he could have used all sorts of shameful means to persuade them to acquit him, but that he would rather face death than incur such shame – just as a soldier would rather die in battle than shamefully surrender to the enemy. </p><ul><li><p><b>Though Socrates faces death, his accusers face the far worse punishment: namely, the damage to their soul brought about by their own vice and injustice.</b></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Socrates prophesies that he will not be the last philosopher.

Philosophy cannot be destroyed by killing one man. </p></li><li><p>Socrates on death:</p><ul><li><p>If death is simply a long sleep, then it is a welcome respite from the suffering of life, and does not harm the one who sleeps.</p></li><li><p>If death involves a migration to the afterlife, then it is a welcome journey, for one will come to converse with all the great wise and heroic people who have come before. (e.g. Homer, Hesiod, Odysseus, etc.) </p></li><li><p>Even in the afterlife, Socrates would engage in his characteristic activity of asking people about their wisdom, as he did in life. </p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Socrates’ Final Statements (p. 63/41c-42a)</h3><ul><li><p>“But you too, gentlemen of the jury, should be of good hope in the face of death, and bear in mind this single truth: nothing bad can happen to a good man, whether in life or in death, nor are the gods unconcerned about his troubles. What has happened to me hasn’t happened by chance; rather, it’s clear to me that to die now and escape my troubles was a better thing for me. It was for this very reason that my sign never opposed me. And so, for my part, I’m not at all angry with those who voted to condemn me or with my accusers. And yet this wasn’t what they had in mind when they were condemning and accusing me. No, they thought to harm me – and for that they deserve to be blamed.” (63/41c-d)</p></li><li><p>“This small favor, however, I ask of them. When my sons come of age, gentlemen, punish them by harassing them in the very same way that I harassed you, if they seem to you to take care of wealth or anything before virtue, if they think they’re someone when they’re no one. Reproach them, just as I reproached you: tell them that they don’t care for the things they should and think they’re someone when they’re worth nothing. If you will do that, I’ll have received my own just deserts from you, as will my sons.” (63/41e-42a) <b>[Socratic humor!]</b></p></li><li><p>“But now it’s time to leave, I to die and you to live. Which of us goes to the better thing, however, is unclear to everyone except the god.” (63/42a)</p></li></ul><h3>Main Points and Questions</h3><ul><li><p>Main Points:</p><ul><li><p>Two charges: corrupting the youth and impiety towards the gods</p></li><li><p>Socrates is the wisest person in Athens because he alone knows that he knows nothing (whereas other people think they know various things, but don’t)</p></li><li><p>Socrates as the ‘gadfly’ of the city</p></li><li><p>The unexamined life is not worth living.</p><ul><li><p>Socrates is willing to face death rather than give up philosophizing, which he regards as a life project in the service of justice, virtue, goodness, etc. Socrates as a martyr for philosophy.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Questions:</p><ul><li><p>Was Socrates guilty of the two charges against him?
